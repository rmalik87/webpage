Rahul Kumar is pursuing PhD degree in Microelectronics and VLSI Group, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/ECE/pages/People+Faculty+Brajesh_Kumar_Kaushik.html"> Dr. Brajesh Kumar Kaushik </a> and 
<a href="http://faculty.iitr.ac.in/~balarfma/"> Prof. Raman Balasubramanian </a>. Mr. Kumar received Masters of Technology (M.Tech.) degree with honour in 2015 from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. He has served as a reviewer of IET circuits, devices and systems, Springer circuits, systems, and signal processing, and IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems. He is a recipient of the prestigious "Newton-Bhabha" fellowship. He has received many awards and recognition from national and international organizations. He has published several research publications in reputed journals and conference proceedings. His research interests are in the areas of low-power VLSI design, architecture and algorithm co-design, image processing, reconfigurable architectures, deep learning, and machine vision. He is student member of  IEEE and SPIE research societies.
